The developer of this project has taken Rock Paper Scissor dataset from tensorflow datasets. We check the accuracy of the model by testing the test data using the evaluate function and passing the test images and To check the same model with Rmsprop optimization, instead of Adam, we train another model with Rmsprop optimization. We consider the rest of the parameters constant.their labels
