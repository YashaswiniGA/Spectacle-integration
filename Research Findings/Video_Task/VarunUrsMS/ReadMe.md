## RetinaNet Object Detection on Video Documentation

This documentation provides an explanation of the provided Python code, which demonstrates how to perform object detection using the RetinaNet model on a video file. The code utilizes the OpenCV and PyTorch libraries to load the model, process each frame of the video, and draw bounding boxes around detected objects.

### Required Libraries
Before running the code, make sure the following libraries are installed:

- `cv2`: OpenCV library for video processing and visualization.
- `torch`: PyTorch library for deep learning and neural networks.
- `torchvision`: PyTorch computer vision library for pre-trained models and image transformations.
- `PIL`: Python Imaging Library for handling images.

### Code Overview

1. **Importing Required Libraries**: The necessary libraries are imported at the beginning of the code.

2. **Loading the RetinaNet Model**: The RetinaNet model, based on the ResNet-50 backbone, is loaded using the `retinanet_resnet50_fpn` function from `torchvision.models.detection`. The model is then set to evaluation mode using the `model.eval()` function.

3. **Defining Transforms**: The `ToTensor()` transform from `torchvision.transforms` is defined to convert the loaded frames into PyTorch tensors.

4. **Opening the Video File**: The input video file is opened using OpenCV's `cv2.VideoCapture` function. The file path of the video is provided as `video_path`.

5. **Getting Video Properties**: Various properties of the video are retrieved using OpenCV's capture functions, such as the frame rate (`fps`), total number of frames (`total_frames`), and dimensions (`width` and `height`) of the video frames.

6. **Creating a VideoWriter**: A `VideoWriter` object is created to save the output video. The desired output file path is provided as `output_path`, and the video codec is specified as `mp4v`. The frame rate and dimensions of the output video are set to match the input video.

7. **Processing Frames**: A function named `process_frame` is defined to handle the processing of each video frame and drawing bounding boxes on the frame. This function takes the frame and the frame number as inputs.

8. **Converting Frame to PIL Image**: The frame is first converted from the OpenCV format (BGR) to the PIL format (RGB) using the `cv2.cvtColor` function. The resulting image is then converted to a PIL `Image` object.

9. **Applying Transforms and Preprocessing**: The defined `transform` is applied to the PIL `Image` to convert it into a PyTorch tensor. The `ToTensor` transform converts the image to a tensor and normalizes the pixel values to the range [0, 1]. Additionally, a batch dimension is added to the tensor.

10. **Running Inference**: The preprocessed image tensor is passed through the RetinaNet model to obtain the predicted bounding boxes, labels, and scores. The `model` is called with the image tensor as input, and the predictions are obtained.

11. **Drawing Bounding Boxes**: The bounding boxes, labels, and scores are extracted from the predictions. Bounding boxes with scores above a threshold of 0.7 are considered for display. For each bounding box, a rectangle is drawn on the frame using the `cv2.rectangle` function, and the corresponding label and score are displayed using the `cv2.putText` function.

12. **Writing Frames to Output Video**: The frame, with the drawn bounding boxes, is written to the output video using the `out.write(frame)` function.

13. **Displaying Progress**: The code calculates and displays the percentage completion of saving the video frames, based on the current frame number and the total number of frames.

14. **Processing Each Frame**: The main loop iterates over each frame of the input video. It reads the next frame using the `cap.read()` function. If the frame retrieval is successful, it calls the `process_frame` function to perform object detection and drawing of bounding boxes. The loop continues until there are no more frames to read.

15. **Exiting the Program**: Pressing the 'q' key on the keyboard during video processing will exit the program and stop video processing.

16. **Releasing Resources**: After processing all the frames, the input video file and output video file are released using the `cap.release()` and `out.release()` functions, respectively. The OpenCV windows are closed using the `cv2.destroyAllWindows()` function.

### Usage Instructions

To use the provided code for performing object detection on a video file:

1. Install the required libraries mentioned at the beginning of the documentation, if not already installed.

2. Replace the `video_path` variable with the path to your input video file.

3. Set the desired `output_path` variable to specify the location where the output video should be saved.

4. Adjust the `score` threshold in the `process_frame` function if you want to display bounding boxes with scores higher or lower than the default threshold of 0.7.

5. Run the code, and the processed video with bounding boxes will be saved to the specified `output_path`. The progress of video processing will be displayed in the console.
